        <p>I like to compartmentalize my goals into two categories: professional and personal. I’ll begin with my professional goals. I enjoy projects that require teamwork when the team is equally motivated to accomplish a big-impact goal. I also enjoy the idea of using creative problem-solving skills. For this reason, I decided to join the information technology industry. This was a recent career change that began when I discovered how similar my intelligence background was to cyber security. I couldn’t jump straight into cyber security without first understanding the basic foundations of hardware, software, networks, internet-connected systems, and how data travels among all these components. I’m new to the industry and have a long way to go, but I’ve made remarkable progress in a short amount of time. I’m currently in a full stack software development course. Professionally I want to continue to grow within my IT field. Personally, I’d like to travel more. I’ve discovered that during my travels I’ve widened my perspective and become more self-aware. My personal beliefs are simple. I believe in working hard and living a life of purpose. Like most second-generation immigrants, much of my self-worth comes from my achievements. I feel a sense of responsibility towards making my parents proud, as they have sacrificed too much to live a mediocre life.
